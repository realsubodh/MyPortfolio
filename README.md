## Portfolio Website For Developers ðŸ’¯

**UPDATE:**


1. Wrote a detailed blog on [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-build-a-portfolio-site-with-nextjs-tailwindcss/), describing and explaining how I built this application from the ground up.

2. Included the `constants` folder, where you can directly add your details and it'll get reflected throughout the application. No more customizations for the template required, just add your data and it'll reflect immediately.

Portfolio for developers is a simple and minimalistic website to showcase your skills and projects as a developer. The design is inspired by [Kevin Clark](https://kevinclark.ca). The website is completely Open Source, you can use it for whatever purpose you want.



# Features

- Responsive layout, works well on both Mobile and Desktop
- Dark mode support. Click buttons to toggle dark mode and light mode.
- Clear React components and tailwind styling.
- Exact sections that a developer needs to showcase their skills.
- Clear call to actions.

# Pages

I've kept the pages as simple as possible. Only the required sections are included with minimal content.



# License

This template is completely open source and free to use. Use it for client projects or your own portfolio project. Give me credits at the footer (If you wish, it'll help me a lot :)).
