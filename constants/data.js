      `I embarked on my coding journey four years ago during the lockdown, diving first into C programming and quickly progressing to Python and C++. My passion for Data Structures and Algorithms has been pivotal in building a solid technical foundation, which I continue to develop alongside my CSE studies at LPU.`,
      `From the beginning, web development captured my interest. I’ve honed my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and, more recently, React.js and Tailwind CSS—crafting seamless, responsive interfaces has become second nature to me. I've worked on a range of projects for myself, classmates, and clients, each reinforcing my expertise in frontend technologies.`,
       `As I push forward, I’m excited to expand into backend development to complete the stack and fully realize my goal of becoming a full-stack developer with a strong command of both frontend and algorithmic problem-solving.`,
